# ALgorithm-analysis-project

This project implements and compares the performance of various sorting algorithms in Java. The implemented sorting algorithms include:

1 - Insertion sort

2 - Selection Sort

3 - Bubble Sort

4-  Merge Sort

5 - Randomized QuickSort

Input: 

The program accepts arrays containing a mix of numbers (real or integers) and alphabets. Priority is given to numbers, followed by alphabets. For example, the input "5, 1, R, A, 8A" will be arranged as "1, 5, 8A, A, R".


Random Arrays:

The program generates three random arrays of size 1000 for performance testing.
